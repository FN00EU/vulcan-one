# vulcan-one
Vulcan ONE API is a Go project that provides dynamic handling of API endpoints for Ethereum-related functionalities, such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 token operations. The API allows users to create webhooks on EVM compatible chain on standardized contracts by specifying the desired contract standard, amount, and address in the API call.
